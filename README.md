# Ford Fulkerson Max-Flow / Min Cut Algorithm
Simple implementation to find the maximum flow through a flow network (no Capacity Scaling)

- adjacenty matrix (not lsit)
  - directed graph details (row 1st)
- augmentation path
- convert int indexes to Strings
- `bottleneck` is the smallest capacity in the augmentation path found in the residual graph (the limiting factor)
